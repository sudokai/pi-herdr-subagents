# Design note: the full-socket herdr client

**Status:** future work — not scheduled. This documents what an all-socket client would look
like, why we did not build it for v1, and the drafted (not yet filed) upstream feature request
that would remove the exit-code sidecar.

## Where we are today (the hybrid, PLAN.md Key Decision #1)

- **Request/response** (`plugin.pane.open`, `plugin.list`, `pane.get`, `pane.list`,
  `pane.close`, `pane.send_keys`, `ping`) goes through the **`herdr` CLI** as a subprocess per
  call, with JSON envelope parsing (`src/herdr/client.ts`; pattern adapted from pi-herdr, MIT).
- **Event subscription** uses a **raw ndJSON unix-socket connection**
  (`src/herdr/events.ts`): one process-wide `events.subscribe` for `pane.exited` +
  `pane.closed`, with reconnect + reconcile.

Why the split: the released CLI has no long-lived `events.subscribe` wrapper. Subscription needs
a persistent connection the CLI cannot provide, so the socket client exists *only* for the event
stream, and everything else rides the CLI, which absorbs protocol drift for us.

Verified socket facts this design rests on (originally probed on herdr 0.7.1 and retained with
the herdr >= 0.8.2 plugin-pane migration):

- Socket path comes from `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`, injected into every pane (named sessions get
  per-session sockets under `~/.config/herdr/sessions/<name>/` transparently).
- Wire format is newline-delimited JSON. Subscribe request/ack/event shapes:

  ```
  → {"id":"sub1","method":"events.subscribe","params":{"subscriptions":[{"type":"pane.exited"},{"type":"pane.closed"}]}}
  ← {"id":"sub1","result":{"type":"subscription_started"}}
  ← {"event":"pane_exited","data":{"pane_id":"w1:p4","type":"pane_exited","workspace_id":"w1"}}
  ```

- `pane.exited` carries **no exit code**, and pane records vanish on exit — hence the
  `<session>.exitcode` sidecar written by the wrapper script (Key Decision #6).
- Global `pane.exited`/`pane.closed` subscriptions work without a `pane_id`;
  `pane.agent_status_changed` requires a per-pane `pane_id`.
- `events.subscribe` has **no replay**: events during a disconnect are gone, so reconnect must
  reconcile (we `pane list` and treat watched-but-missing panes as exited).

## What full-socket would look like

One persistent connection per pi process, owned by a `HerdrSocketClient`:

- **Correlation**: every request gets a monotonically increasing `id`; responses are matched
  by `id` to pending promises. Push events (no `id`, an `event` field) are dispatched to the
  existing subscription fan-out. This merges `client.ts` and `events.ts` into one connection
  state machine.
- **Bootstrap + cache**: on connect, call `session.snapshot` and keep a local cache of
  pane/agent records, updated from events. The socket-api docs are explicit about this shape:

  > `session.snapshot` returns a one-time bootstrap snapshot for clients that keep their own
  > local runtime cache. […] It is not a subscription; after reading it, subscribe to resource
  > events and update the local cache from those events. Call `session.snapshot` again after
  > reconnecting or when the local cache may be stale.

  Reconnect therefore becomes: reconnect → re-subscribe → re-snapshot → diff against watched
  panes (subsuming today's `pane list` reconcile).
- **Typed method map** for the methods we actually use: `ping`, `session.snapshot`,
  `plugin.list`, `plugin.pane.open`, `pane.list`, `pane.get`, `pane.close`, `pane.send_keys`,
  `events.subscribe`
  (request/response/event types generated or hand-written against `herdr api schema --json`
  once the CLI ships it).
- The `ExecFn` unit-test seam is replaced by a scripted-socket seam (we already test
  `events.ts` against a real `net.createServer` on a temp socket path — that harness
  generalizes).

### Gains

- No subprocess per request (today: fork+exec of the CLI for every spawn/list/close/ping).
- Atomic view of the session (snapshot + ordered events, no CLI-call interleaving).
- Lower latency; matters little at subagent scale (spawns are ~12ms via CLI already).

### Costs

- We own protocol-version drift the CLI currently absorbs (request shapes, envelope changes,
  version negotiation against `ping.protocol`).
- Platform differences (Windows named pipes vs unix sockets) become our problem.
- More mocking surface: every request/response test needs the scripted socket instead of
  canned CLI envelopes.

## Trigger conditions for revisiting

Build the full-socket client when any of these lands:

1. **`herdr api` CLI ships in a released herdr** (schema available via
   `herdr api schema --json` → typed method map becomes cheap and drift-checkable).
2. **`pane.exited` gains `exit_code`** (see FR below) — the sidecar dies, and the watcher
   becomes pure-socket, at which point the hybrid's remaining CLI half is mostly launch.
3. Subprocess overhead becomes measurable (e.g. very high spawn/list frequency).

## Drafted upstream feature request (NOT yet filed)

To be filed against `ogulcancelik/herdr` when ready
(`gh issue create --repo ogulcancelik/herdr`). Once implemented upstream, the
`<session>.exitcode` sidecar and its watcher path can be deleted.

> **Title:** Include exit code in `pane.exited` event payload
>
> **Body:**
>
> When a pane's process exits, the socket API emits `pane.exited`:
>
> ```json
> {"event":"pane_exited","data":{"pane_id":"w1:p4","type":"pane_exited","workspace_id":"w1"}}
> ```
>
> The payload carries no exit code, and the pane record is already gone by the time the event
> is observable (`pane.get` returns not-found), so a socket client cannot distinguish a clean
> exit from a crash.
>
> **Use case:** pi-herdr-subagents launches pi subagents through an argv-backed
> `plugin.pane.open` dispatcher and classifies their lifecycle from socket events. "Exited 0" vs
> "exited nonzero" is the difference between *completed* and *crashed / failed to launch* — e.g.
> a typo'd `--model`
> makes the child exit nonzero within a second, and we want to report that truthfully. Today we
> work around it with a wrapper script that writes the exit code to a sidecar file
> (`<session>.exitcode`), which adds a wrapper layer to what could be a plain argv launch and a
> filesystem watch to what could be pure socket observation.
>
> **Request:** add the child process's exit status to the `pane.exited` payload, e.g.
>
> ```json
> {"event":"pane_exited","data":{"pane_id":"w1:p4","type":"pane_exited","workspace_id":"w1","exit_code":1}}
> ```
>
> (or `exit_code: null` plus a `signal` field when the process was signal-killed). Observed on
> herdr 0.8.2.
