# pi-herdr-subagents

Interactive subagent orchestration for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), built natively
on [herdr](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr) — spawn, resume, and interrupt subagents in
herdr panes with truthful lifecycle events. **Fully non-blocking**: spawning returns an
immediate ack, the parent ends its turn, and results are steered back as async messages that
wake it up.

## Origins & credit

This extension is a herdr-native descendant of
[pi-interactive-subagents](https://github.com/HazAT/pi-interactive-subagents) by
[HazAT](https://github.com/HazAT). I used that extension daily for months and it completely
changed how I structure my agent work. The orchestration model here is its design — spawn
subagents into visible terminal surfaces, get woken by steer messages when they
finish, resume/interrupt/list, markdown agent definitions — and several modules are direct
ports (see [License](#license)). I've also contributed improvements upstream. If you work in
tmux, cmux, zellij, or wezterm — or need Claude Code children — use pi-interactive-subagents;
it's excellent.

## Why a separate herdr-native extension

pi-interactive-subagents drives its four muxes through one generic backend mechanism: create a
pane, wait for its interactive shell, *type a launch command into it*, verify startup with
retries, and poll the screen for a completion sentinel. Its hardest reliability edge cases
trace back to that open-loop mechanism — a shell still running direnv/devenv init can swallow
the typed command, and a dead child looks like a screen that stopped changing (the war story is
in [`docs/PROJECT-BRIEF.md`](docs/PROJECT-BRIEF.md)).

To be fair: that mechanism is an implementation choice more than a hard limit of the muxes.
tmux, zellij, and wezterm can all launch a command directly at pane creation, and sidecar files
can replace screen scraping — pi-interactive-subagents could plausibly be retrofitted with
per-backend launch and lifecycle adapters (cmux's currently exposed CLI is the awkward one, and
push-style lifecycle events aren't uniformly available). But that retrofit is a substantial
refactor multiplied across every backend and both of its launch paths. Rather than carry that
surface area, this extension targets herdr only and uses its native primitives directly:

- **argv process launch** (`herdr agent start … -- bash <script>`): the child is started as a
  direct process. No shell, no typing, no delays — **the launch race cannot happen, by
  construction**. There is no verify/retry machinery because there is nothing to verify.
- **Socket events** (`events.subscribe` → `pane.exited` / `pane.closed`): a child that dies is
  an observable event within milliseconds, not a screen that stopped changing.

## Requirements

- **herdr ≥ 0.7.1** (protocol 14 — pinned; the extension pings the socket at session start and
  warns if the server is unreachable)
- **pi running inside a herdr pane.** herdr injects `HERDR_ENV`, `HERDR_PANE_ID`, and
  `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` into every pane; the extension activates only when they are present.
- **pi children only.** Claude Code / codex subagents are an explicit non-goal — if you need
  them, use [pi-interactive-subagents](https://github.com/HazAT/pi-interactive-subagents).
  Agent defs with `cli: claude` produce a clear "unsupported" error.
- node ≥ 22.

## Setup

Install as a pi package (add to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`):

```jsonc
{
  "packages": [
    "/path/to/pi-herdr-subagents"   // local checkout; or a git: URL once published
  ]
}
```

Then start herdr in your terminal and run pi in a pane:

```bash
herdr          # opens the multiplexer
# in a pane:
pi
```

The `subagent`, `subagent_resume`, `subagent_interrupt`, and `subagents_list` tools plus the
`/subagent`, `/subagents-init`, and `/iterate` commands appear automatically.

To install the package's four example agent definitions (`worker`, `planner`, `scout`, and
`reviewer`) as user-owned files, run:

```text
/subagents-init           # global: ~/.pi/agent/agents/
/subagents-init project   # project-local: .pi/agents/
```

The command creates the target directory and copies only missing files. Existing files and
symlinks are skipped, so customized definitions are never overwritten. The copies are not tied
to the package after installation: later package updates will not replace them; run the command
again only to install template filenames that are still missing.

**Outside herdr** the extension registers nothing at load. At `session_start`, if no other
extension provides a `subagent` tool, it registers setup-hint stubs that explain how to run pi
inside herdr (so the model gets a clear answer instead of a missing tool). If another extension
already provides `subagent` (e.g. pi-interactive-subagents in tmux), it registers nothing and
the other extension wins cleanly.

## Transition: running side-by-side with pi-interactive-subagents

Tool names are **identical by design**: agent-def `spawning: false` / `deny-tools` frontmatter
gates the exact names `subagent`, `subagent_resume`, `subagent_interrupt`, `subagents_list`,
and existing orchestrator prompts reference those names in prose. pi resolves duplicate tool
names **first-loaded-extension-wins, silently** — so ordering matters:

> **List `pi-herdr-subagents` BEFORE `pi-interactive-subagents` in `packages`.**

Behavior matrix during the transition:

| pi is running… | active provider |
|---|---|
| inside a herdr pane | **pi-herdr-subagents** (registers at load, wins the race) |
| inside tmux/cmux/zellij/wezterm | pi-interactive-subagents (this extension stays silent) |
| outside any mux | whichever is loaded; ours only adds setup-hint stubs if nothing else provides `subagent` |

If this extension is inside herdr but *lost* the registry race (loaded after another `subagent`
provider), it emits a visible `session_start` warning telling you to fix the package order —
it never fails silently.

No relation to [pi-herdr](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/pi-extensions) (the generic
user-facing pane tool): no dependency in either direction, no name collisions (`herdr` vs
`subagent*`); they coexist fine.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables (set globally, or per-project via `.envrc`):

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `PI_HERDR_LAUNCH_PREFIX` | *(unset)* | Template for the command wrapping the child pi invocation; `{cwd}` is interpolated shell-escaped. **If defined (even empty) it replaces direnv autodetection**; empty string disables wrapping entirely. Examples: `direnv exec {cwd}` (the autodetect default), `mise exec --`, `nix develop {cwd} -c`. |
| `PI_HERDR_PI_BIN` | first executable `pi` on `PATH` | Absolute path of the pi binary to launch children with (e.g. `~/.local/bin/pi`). |
| `PI_HERDR_DIRENV` | *(unset)* | Set to `0` to disable the `direnv exec` autodetect (see below). |
| `PI_HERDR_HOLD_OPEN_SECS` | `15` | Startup-crash window: if the child exits nonzero within this many seconds, the pane is held open for post-mortem (`0` disables). |
| `HERDR_BIN` | `herdr` on `PATH` | herdr binary override. |

### direnv / devenv / varlock repos

Spawning into a repo whose environment lives behind direnv (devenv, nix, varlock-managed
secrets) is a first-class case — it is exactly where typed-launch muxes fail. The generated
launch script exports the **orchestrator's PATH** plus curated `PI_SUBAGENT_*` vars (never a
full env dump), and when the child's effective cwd (or an ancestor, up to `$HOME`) has an
`.envrc`, the pi invocation is wrapped in `direnv exec '<cwd>'`. That wrap materializes the
devenv environment — node, pnpm, postgres, project env vars — before pi starts. If your `pi`
is itself a wrapper that needs in-env tools (e.g. varlock for 1Password-backed secrets), it
runs inside that environment and just works; the extension needs zero knowledge of it. The
whole chain — launch script → `direnv exec` → devenv PATH → pi wrapper → varlock — is covered
by an integration test against a real devenv checkout (`test/integration/direnv-env.test.ts`).
Set `PI_HERDR_DIRENV=0` or an explicit `PI_HERDR_LAUNCH_PREFIX` to override.

## Tools & commands

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `subagent` | Spawn a sub-agent in a dedicated herdr pane (async — returns immediately) |
| `subagent_resume` | Resume a previous sub-agent session in a new pane (async) |
| `subagent_interrupt` | Send Escape to a running subagent's active turn |
| `subagents_list` | List available agent definitions (project-local `.pi/agents/` overrides global) |

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/subagent <agent> [task]` | Spawn a named agent directly |
| `/subagents-init [global\|project]` | Copy missing example agent definitions into user-owned config |
| `/iterate [task]` | Fork the current session into a subagent for focused work |

Agent definitions in project-local `.pi/agents/*.md` or global `~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md` are read
with the same frontmatter semantics as pi-interactive-subagents (name, description, tools,
deny-tools, model, thinking, spawning, auto-exit, interactive, session-mode, systemPromptMode,
…) — the same defs drive both extensions during the transition. The package templates are not a
runtime fallback; `/subagents-init` explicitly copies them into one of these user-owned
locations. A `subagent_done` / `caller_ping` child extension is loaded into every child for the
completion handshake.

## Lifecycle: every child ends in exactly one honest state

The watcher classifies each child from socket events + sidecar files. There is **no path to an
eternal "stalled" zombie** — every row below terminates the running entry with a steer message:

| What happened | Steer you get |
|---|---|
| child called `subagent_done` | `completed` + summary (last assistant message) |
| child called `caller_ping` | `subagent_ping` + the child's question + session path |
| user drove the child and quit pi without `subagent_done` | distinct honest phrasing: *"closed by user, no subagent_done"* + last message + session path |
| child exited nonzero within the startup window (e.g. bad `--model`) | `failed to launch (exit code N)` + pane id + launch script path; pane held open for post-mortem |
| child crashed later | exit code + last message + session path (resumable) |
| pane killed externally (no sidecars) | honest failure steer + session path (resumable) |
| pane vanished while the event stream was down | classified from on-disk sidecars, else *"ended while event stream was down"* |

## Differences vs pi-interactive-subagents

- **No launch race, by construction.** argv launch replaces type-into-shell; the shell-ready
  delay, launch verify/retry loop, and sentinel screen polling have no analog here.
- **Truthful crash/lifecycle steers.** `pane.exited` + exit-code sidecar give immediate, honest
  launch-failure and crash reporting (a bad `--model` used to produce a silent zombie).
- **No stall-status machinery.** The `starting/active/waiting/stalled` state machine and
  activity files are gone — herdr's sidebar shows semantic per-pane agent state, and dead
  children can no longer masquerade as "stalled". The status widget is a slim
  name/agent/elapsed/count list.
- **Distinct user-exit phrasing.** A user quitting a child without `subagent_done` is reported
  as exactly that, not as a generic completion.
- **pi children only.** No Claude Code CLI path, no transcript-copy machinery.
- **Panes auto-close** on clean exit (held open only for startup crashes).
- **herdr only.** No cmux/tmux/zellij/wezterm code paths.

## Debugging

Artifacts live under the orchestrator's session dir, same convention as
pi-interactive-subagents — `<sessionDir>/artifacts/<session-id>/`:

```
artifacts/<session-id>/
├── context/<name>-<ts>.md            # task handoff file (child's initial @-message)
├── context/<name>-sysprompt-<ts>.md  # system prompt file (when the agent def provides one)
├── subagent-scripts/<name>-<id>.sh   # the generated launch script (the single source of truth
│                                     #   for env exports, direnv wrap, pi argv)
└── subagent-resume/<name>-<ts>.md    # resume follow-up messages
```

Next to each child session file (`…/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<ts>_<id>.jsonl`):

- `<session>.exit` — semantic completion sidecar written by the child
  (`{"type":"done"}` or `{"type":"ping",…}`)
- `<session>.exitcode` — process exit code written by the wrapper script

Useful tricks:

- **Startup crashes hold the pane open** (default 15s window) with the error visible — read it,
  then press Enter in the pane to close.
- **Re-run any launch by hand**: `bash <artifacts>/subagent-scripts/<name>-<id>.sh` reproduces
  the exact child environment and invocation.
- Every failure steer carries the child session path; `pi --session <path>` resumes it, or use
  `subagent_resume`.

## Known limitations / upstream notes

- **Exit-code sidecar**: herdr's `pane.exited` event carries no exit code and pane records
  vanish on exit, so the wrapper script writes `<session>.exitcode`. A herdr feature request
  for `exit_code` on `pane.exited` is drafted (not yet filed) in
  [`docs/full-socket-client.md`](docs/full-socket-client.md) — once it lands, the sidecar can
  be deleted.
- **No stall detection** (yet): a child that is alive but spinning its wheels is not flagged;
  herdr's sidebar agent states are the current signal. Could be reintroduced on
  `pane.agent_status_changed`.
- **Single-workspace topology**: children split into the orchestrator's tab
  (`--tab $HERDR_TAB_ID --split right`); multi-workspace layouts are unexplored.
- **Hybrid client**: request/response goes through the `herdr` CLI; only `events.subscribe`
  uses a raw socket connection. The all-socket design (and when to switch) is sketched in
  [`docs/full-socket-client.md`](docs/full-socket-client.md).

## Development

```bash
npm test                  # unit suite (mocked herdr boundary), ~0.6s
npm run test:integration  # real pi children in an isolated named herdr session
                          # (needs herdr + tmux + model auth; skips cleanly otherwise)
```

The integration harness creates its own tmux session and named herdr session
(`herdr-subagents-test-<pid>-…`), points `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` at a temp dir, and refuses to
run against the default herdr socket — your live sessions and global pi config are never
touched.
